NAME
       psmaster - perform some action

SYNOPSIS
       psmaster [OPTION] [FILE]
       psmaster [-h|-V]

DESCRIPTION
       psmaster can "master patch" a PlayStation 2 disc image given in
       FILE, allowing it to be run on a TEST console.

       Sony produced a special set of PlayStation 2 consoles, called TEST
       systems. These systems differ from retail models primarily in their
       ability to play games from CD-R and DVD-R media, allowing copied
       games to be run. However, these consoles will only recognize burned
       media as valid if they contain "master data" in sectors 12 and 13 of
       the disc.  These sectors are zeroed out on all retail games. Using
       psmaster, it is possible to patch a retail disc image to contain
       master data, allowing the image to be burned to disc and run on a
       PlayStation 2 TEST console.
